            Using found footage from cobblers and sneaker redesigners, a
            documentary offers a glimpse into an alternative world where the
            importance of newness is replaced with heritage, disposability with
            repairability, and mass production with craft. KEY QUESTION? How
            might we shift the values of newness in fashion?

            The investigation began with a look into the future of sports. After
            thorough and broad research, the future of athletic equipment and
            apparel revealed itself as not only consequential to our ability to
            train and play, but also a core aspect of fashion and
            sustainability. Through using frameworks like STEEP and AEIOU, I
            dove deeper into weak signals that stood out through the noise. It
            was clear that the fashion industry was shifting to address its
            effects on climate, and evolving consumer mindsets. Evidence
            suggested new ways of buying, approaches to raw materials, and
            overall, a need to change our relationship to clothing as we know
            it. One question stood out, how would brands make refurbish or
            repaired clothing more attractive than something new?

            To understand my question more thoroughly I interviewed Rory
            Fortune, a modern day cobbler that runs a shop called Goods and
            Services, and Kempe Scanlan, a fashion designer, trends consultant,
            and futurist. Conversations brought to light the intricacies of how
            the fashion landscape was changing, both through Scanlan’s
            experience as a trends consultant and through Fortune’s first hand
            experience as a shop owner. They also revealed the possibilities of
            the digital fashion space, which on the surface felt like a
            counterpoint to repaired and refurbished physical fashion, but in
            reality hinted at opportunities about how the digital and physical
            could support one another.

            Based on my research I decided to focus on sneakers because of its
            importance to iconic brands like Nike, its evolution from something
            repairable to disposable, and the fanatic culture that surrounds it.
            I began developing a story to illustrate the culture a new culture
            around sneakers, centering around the people that make the shoes,
            the stories and connections we can make with clothing and how we
            could extend them through repair, and touching on how a digital
            footwear market could aid this shift. As a vehicle for the story, I
            started edited a short documentary using found footage to immerse my
            audience into an alternative world where culture around fashion has
            fundamentally changed.

            The resulting short film hints at a world where sustainable fashion
            is very much within reach through revitalizing tools, our
            relationship with artisans, and retooling our relationship with
            clothing. It suggests how a brand like Nike could participate in
            this process, and how people could relate with clothing differently.
